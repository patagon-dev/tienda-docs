# Resume

> The following design is an architecture **proposal** which can be modified or adapted.
{.is-info}


# Plataform Suggestion

> üëâ Start from latest [Spree Commerce vesion](https://github.com/spree/spree) (4.6.2).\
> üëâ Use [Spree Starter Dockerize](https://github.com/spree/spree_starter) version.\
> üëâ Use [Spree Legacy frontend](https://github.com/spree/spree_rails_frontend) Gem.\
> üëâ Use [Spree Multi-Vendor](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_multi_vendor) Gem.\
{.is-info}


**Missing features:**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Single Sing On (SSO)** Gem (openid connect or SAML ?)\
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Custom integration with <kbd>Clave Unica</kbd>, local Identity Provider (OpenID Connect)\
> ‚ö†Ô∏è B2B logic.\
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Custom Checkout Workflows\
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Custom Catalog\
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Custom Cart Management\
{.is-warning}


## Logic Complexities

> üëâ Cart should be related to SubOrganizations (aka "Destinatario").\
> üëâ Cart logic will be different depending on the [Type of Purchase](../functionalities/purchase-type.md).\
> üëâ Product Catalog should be related to [Type or Purchase](../functionalities/purchase-type.md) (aka "Canal").\
> üëâ Checkout workflow will be different depending on the [Type of Purchase](../functionalities/purchase-type.md).\
{.is-warning}



# Data Management

> ‚ö†Ô∏è All Data will be provided by **third party services** APIs. User, Products, Vendors.\
> ‚ö†Ô∏è We will probably need to implement different sicronization methods (daily, on the fly, etc).\
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Each API has it's own authentication method, cache policies, etc. <mark>**Maybe we should implement and API Gateway ?**</mark>\
{.is-danger}


> In order to Dockerize the application, we need to save all assets (images) in an external storage, most probably a S3 bucket.
{.is-warning}

# Queue Management

> ‚ö†Ô∏è In the Checkout flow, we will need to integrate with external services for purchase order creation, budget validation, etc. We need to implement a nice Queue flow for jobs management.
