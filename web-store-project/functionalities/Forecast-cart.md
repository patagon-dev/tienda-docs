### Expected Behaviour

> Intermediacion Cart
> 1. ðŸ‘‰ User has selected the `intermediacion` channel.
> 2. ðŸ‘‰ The Cart has an explicit date when it will be delivered.
> 3. ðŸ‘‰ User can review the next 3 months. Only 1 cart exits per month.
> 4. ðŸ‘‰ Cart is preloaded with the [Forecast API](../../api-rest-services/forecast.md). User **can't** modify the Cart products **nor** quantities.
> 5. ðŸ‘‰ <kbd>ZGEN</kbd> products **don't have a price**.
